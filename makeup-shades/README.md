## shades.csv

- 	**What is this?**: Data representing the shades of foundation offered by a variety of beauty brands around the world.
-   **Source(s) & Methods**: We collected a list of beauty brands in the US, Nigeria, India, and Japan that were considered by several sources to be "best sellers" in their home countries. We visited each brand's website during May 2018, found their liquid foundation line that (at the time of our sampling) had the largest number of shades available, and recorded the hex color values for each of the colored swatches shown for the product. Then, using Adobe Photoshop, we extracted the lightness value of each color (using the [CIE Lab color model](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/color-modes.html#lab_color_mode)). Sources consulted to decide what brands/products to sample:
